# polymer-hyper

> Working example with Polymer 3 and [hyperHTML](https://github.com/WebReflection/hyperHTML)

## What

Extending the `PropertyAccessors` class from the Polymer mixins [I was able to use `lit-html` for rendering.](https://github.com/LasaleFamine/polymer-3-lit)
This is a simple test to work with `hyperHTML` instead of `lit`, inside a Polymer 3 element.

Just check the source code to understand better and fill an issue if I'm making mistakes!

## Build and dev

    yarn build # Just build the bundle

    yarn start # Run http-server on src folder

    yarn dev # webpack -w

    yarn test # xo

## Feedbacks appreciate!
